Tests tried to send web hook:

1. Separate file with Node.js code (works) sending to webhook.
2. Including file and calling it within oauth portion (doesn't work).
3. Using request directly in the oauth route (doesn't work).
4. Separate function (within main) which is referenced in oauth (doesn't work).
